# 
# This workflow determines which sub projects of a monorepo are affected by a PR, and then runs CodeQL analysis on those projects.
#
# It uses Actions from `advanced-security/monorepo-code-scanning-action`
#
# To use it, it would be placed under `./github/workflows` in the monorepo.
#
# The specific language and paths affected are passed to the CodeQL analysis, along with a custom analysis workflow if one is provided.
#
# For TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, Java and C#, you can let the CodeQL Action handle the "build" step,
# and only target the project that is being changed by the PR, using `build-mode: none`.
#
# For other languages (Kotlin, Swift and C/C++) an autobuild will be attempted.
#
# You can instead opt to use `manual` for CodeQL languages, to specify everything about the build and CodeQL analysis.
#
# Non-CodeQL tools are supported using the `other` build-mode in the language/project definition.
#
# Either `manual` or `other` build-modes require a custom analysis workflow.
#
# If you want to specify custom queries, you can do so in the same custom analysis workflow, and set the `manual` build-mode.
#
# You can find an example of what that looks like in this repository at .github/workflows/code-scanning-custom-analysis.yml
